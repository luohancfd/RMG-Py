RRKM theory
===========

.. autofunction:: rmgpy.pdep.applyRRKMTheory

    RRKM (Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus) theory is the microcanonical analogue of
    transition state theory. The microcanonical rate coefficient as a function of
    total energy :math:`E` and total angular momentum quantum number :math:`J` is
    given by

    .. math:: k(E,J) = \frac{N^\ddagger(E, J)}{h \rho(E, J)}

    where :math:`N^\ddagger(E, J)` is the sum of states of the transition state and
    :math:`\rho(E, J)` is the density of states of the reactant. If the J-rotor is
    treated as active, the J-dependence can be averaged in the above expression to
    give

    .. math:: k(E) = \frac{N^\ddagger(E)}{h \rho(E)}

    as a function of total energy alone. This is reasonable at high temperatures,
    but less accurate at low temperatures.

    Use of RRKM theory requires detailed information about the statistical mechanics
    of the reactant *and* transition state. However, it is generally more accurate
    than the inverse Laplace transform method.


Inverse Laplace transform method
================================

.. autofunction:: rmgpy.pdep.applyInverseLaplaceTransformMethod

    The inverse Laplace transform method exploits the following relationship to
    determine the microcanonical rate coefficient:

    .. math:: \mathcal{L} \left[k(E) \rho(E) \right] = \int_0^\infty k(E) \rho(E) e^{-E/k_\mathrm{B} T} \ dE = k_\infty(T) Q(T)

    Given a high-pressure limit rate coefficient :math:`k_\infty(T)` represented as
    an Arrhenius expression with positive :math:`n` and :math:`E_\mathrm{a}`,
    the microcanonical rate coefficient :math:`k(E)` can be determined via an
    inverse Laplace transform. For :math:`n = 0` the transform can be defined
    analytically:

    .. math:: k(E) = A \frac{\rho(E - E_\mathrm{a})}{\rho(E)} \ \ \ \ (n = 0)

    For :math:`n > 0` the transform is defined numerically. For :math:`n < 0` or
    :math:`E_\mathrm{a} < 0` the transform is not defined; in this case we 
    approximate by simply lumping the :math:`T^n` or :math:`e^{-E_\mathrm{a}/RT}`
    terms into the preexponential factor, and use a different :math:`k(E)` at each
    temperature.

    The ILT method does not required detailed transition state information, but only
    the high-pressure limit kinetics. However, it assumes that (1) 
    :math:`k_\infty(T)` is valid over the temperature range from zero to infinity 
    and (2) the activation energy :math:`E_\mathrm{a}` is physically identical to 
    the reaction barrier :math:`E_0^\ddagger - E_0`.
