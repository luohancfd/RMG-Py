Methods for estimating k(T,P) values
************************************

The objective of each of the methods described in this section is to reduce 
the master equation into a small number of phenomenological rate coefficients 
:math:`k(T,P)`. All of the methods share a common formalism in that they seek
to express the population distribution vector :math:`\mathbf{p}_i` for each
unimolecular isomer :math:`i` as a linear combination of the total populations
of all unimolecular isomers and bimolecular reactant channels.

The modified strong collision method
====================================

.. autofunction:: rmgpy.pdep.msc.applyModifiedStrongCollisionMethod

    The modified strong collision method utilizes a greatly simplified collision
    model that allows for a decoupling of the energy grains. In the simplified
    collision model, collisional stabilization of a reactive isomer is treated as a
    single-step process, ignoring the effects of collisional energy redistribution
    within the reactive energy space. An attempt to correct for the effect of
    collisional energy redistribution is made by modifying the collision frequency
    :math:`\omega_i(T,P)` with a collision efficiency :math:`\beta_i(T)` estimated
    from the low-pressure limit fall-off of a single isomer. 

    By approximating the reactive populations as existing in pseudo-steady state, 
    the master equation is converted to a matrix equation is at each energy. Solving
    these small matrix equations gives the pseudo-steady state populations of each
    isomer as a function of the total population of each isomer and reactant 
    channel, which are then applied to determine the :math:`k(T,P)` values.

    In practice, the modified strong collision method is the fastest and most
    robust of the methods, and is reasonably accurate over a wide range of
    temperatures and pressures.

The reservoir state method
==========================

.. autofunction:: rmgpy.pdep.rs.applyReservoirStateMethod

    In the reservoir state method, the population distribution of each isomer is
    partitioned into the low-energy grains (called the *reservoir*) and the
    high-energy grains (called the *active space*). The partition generally occurs
    at or near the lowest transition state energy for each isomer. The reservoir
    population is assumed to be thermalized, while the active-space population is
    assumed to be in pseudo-steady state. Applying these approximations converts
    the master equation into a single large matrix equation. Solving this matrix 
    equation gives the pseudo-steady state populations of each isomer as a function 
    of the total population of each isomer and reactant channel, which are then
    applied to determine the :math:`k(T,P)` values.

    The reservoir state method is only slightly more expensive than the modified
    strong collision method. At low temperatures the approximations used are very
    good, and the resulting :math:`k(T,P)` values are more accurate than the
    modified strong collision values. However, at high temperatures the thermalized
    reservoir approximation breaks down, resulting in very inaccurate 
    :math:`k(T,P)` values. Thus, the reservoir state method is not robustly
    applicable over a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

The chemically-significant eigenvalues method
=============================================

.. autofunction:: rmgpy.pdep.cse.applyChemicallySignificantEigenvaluesMethod

    In the chemically-significant eigenvalues method, the master equation matrix
    is diagonized to determine its eigenmodes. Only the slowest of these modes are
    relevant to the chemistry; the rest involve internal energy relaxation due to
    collisions. Keeping only these "chemically-significant" eigenmodes allows for
    reduction to :math:`k(T,P)` values.

    The chemically-significant eigenvalues method is the most accurate method,
    and is considered to be exact as long as the chemically-significant eigenmodes
    are separable and distinct from the internal energy relaxation eigenmodes.
    However, this is often only the case near the high-pressure limit, even for
    networks of only modest size. The chemically-significant eigenvalues method
    is also substantially more expensive to apply than the other methods.
