    Many vibrational motions are well-described as one-dimensional quantum harmonic
    oscillators. The time-independent Schrodinger equation for such an oscillator
    is given by

    .. math:: -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi(x) + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \Psi(x) = E \Psi(x)

    where :math:`m` is the total mass of the particle. The harmonic potential
    results in quantized solutions to the above with the following energy levels:

    .. math:: E_n = \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar \omega \hspace{2em} n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots

    Above we have introduced :math:`n` as the quantum number. Note that, even in
    the ground state (:math:`n = 0`), the harmonic oscillator has an energy that is
    not zero; this energy is called the *zero-point energy*.

    The harmonic oscillator partition function is obtained by summing over
    the above energy levels:

    .. math:: Q_\mathrm{vib}(T) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \exp \left( -\frac{\left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \hbar \omega}{k_\mathrm{B} T} \right)

    This summation can be evaluated explicitly to give a closed-form analytical
    expression for the vibrational partition function of a quantum harmonic
    oscillator:

    .. math:: Q_\mathrm{vib}(T) = \frac{e^{-\hbar \omega / 2 k_\mathrm{B} T}}{1 - e^{-\hbar \omega / k_\mathrm{B} T}}

    In RMG the convention is to place the zero-point energy in with the
    ground-state energy of the system instead of the numerator of the vibrational
    partition function, which gives

    .. math:: Q_\mathrm{vib}(T) = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\hbar \omega / k_\mathrm{B} T}}

    The energy levels of the harmonic oscillator in chemical systems are often
    significant compared to the temperature of interest, so we usually use the
    quantum result. However, the classical limit is provided here for completeness:

    .. math:: Q_\mathrm{vib}^\mathrm{cl}(T) = \frac{k_\mathrm{B} T}{\hbar \omega}
